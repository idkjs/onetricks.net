Someone should be able to go on the site and get a good enough idea of what champions are being one tricked into the highest level of play.\nI'm still a student in college, and I'm still new to making complete projects. I simply went with the easiest route (when analyzing the data) and deployed ASAP.\nOver the next few weeks, I'll improve it so that we get more up-to-date data though!",

Although there are slight twists to the phrase one trick pony today, I define it as someone who really excels on one champ, but does below average on other champs. These types of one tricks are much more prominent in higher elo, and I found that a majority of them are easily identifiable and thus are on this list.",
